Hi,

My name's Eric Goebelbecker. I'm a developer, systems engineer, and writer. 

My current position is what is what most would call DevOps for a prop trading firm.

I also write blog posts for Saas firms via the [HitSubscribe](https://hitsubscribe.com). Many of my repos here are sample code for posts I've written over the past few years.
